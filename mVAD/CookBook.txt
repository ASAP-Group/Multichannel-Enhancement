The process of training Voice Activity Detector consists of three main STEPs.
The first one is training data preparation (implemented im Matlab).
The second is the DNN learning (implemented in Troch framework).
The third one is export of the model back into Matlab.
NOTE: The VAD network is already trained and stored in mVAD\sharedData.

These scripts were run on following versions of SW: Matlab R2014a, Torch7, Lua 5.1.5, Cuda 7.5

STEP1_dataPreparation

	script_01_CHiME3_simulate_data_patched
		- This script is based on original CHiME3_simulate_data.m script [1], 
		some of the scripts in the utils directory are therefore under GNU 3 license [2].
		- The script prepares spectrograms of noise, clear speech and mixture which are saved to path specified in "myPth".
		- "chimeDataPath" specifies the location of CHiME data folder.
		
	script_02_getStatsandDataSets
		- This script computes the normalization statistics, randomly splits data into training and validation data sets and prepares binary files for NNET training process.
		- "PTH" is path to mat files prepared by preceding step.
		- "sharedPth" is directory where statistics will be saved.
		- "binPth" is target directory for training binaries (approx. 20 GB of disk space is required and 32 GB RAM).	
	
STEP2_Torch

	script_03_train_sig
		- To train the VAD network, you need to change the "mainPath" in script "STEP2_Torch/scripts/settings_sigOut.lua" to the actual location of "STEP2_Torch" directory.
		- Then run script "step_03_train_sig.lua".
		- We would like to thank Lukáš Matějů for his kind advice and help with the implementation of Torch sctipts 
		(feed-forward neural networks training implementation can be found at [3]).

STEP3_exportAndUse

	script_04_prepare_NETpack
		- This scripts converts .nnet file of the network into Matlab object.
		- To run the script change path to the .nnet file on line 8; set path to the normalization statistics (path to the shared directory) on line 16; and set the path to the shared directory on line 30 so the matlab model is stored there.
  
	script_05_useVAD
		- This script shows, how to call the VAD.
		- Variable "recording" specifies whole path to the processed audio file.
		- Path given on line 10 leads to saved matlab model.
		
The output of the VAD network are 2 masks joined in one matrix (the first one is "voice activity detector", the second one is "noise activity dector").
The size of the matrix is (2 x stft bin number) x (stft frame number).
In our case it is 2*257 x stft frame number.
